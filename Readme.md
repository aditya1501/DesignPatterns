# Design Patterns with Code Implementation

This repository contains a collection of design patterns implemented in code. Each design pattern is accompanied by code examples and explanations to help you understand its purpose and how it can be used in your projects. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository can serve as a valuable resource for learning and applying design patterns in your software development projects.

## Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software development. They provide guidelines and best practices for designing flexible, reusable, and maintainable code. By understanding and applying design patterns, you can improve the structure and efficiency of your software, enhance code readability, and facilitate future changes and extensions.

## Design Patterns

The repository covers three main categories of design patterns:

### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing ways to create objects in a manner that is flexible, decoupled from the implementation details, and reusable. The following creational patterns are included:

- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Singleton
- Builder
- Prototype

### Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition, simplifying the design by identifying relationships between objects and providing a way to compose them into larger structures. The following structural patterns are included:

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns concentrate on communication and interaction between objects, defining the patterns for how objects communicate and behave with one another. The following behavioral patterns are included:

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

For each design pattern, you will find a detailed explanation of its purpose, along with code examples illustrating its implementation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone the repository and navigate to the specific design pattern folder you are interested in. Each pattern has its own folder containing the code examples and relevant explanations. Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt the patterns to suit your specific project requirements.
